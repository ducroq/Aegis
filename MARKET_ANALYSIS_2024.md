## Historical Context: Money Printing & Valuation Bubble

### The Post-2008 Era
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has engaged in multiple rounds of "money printing" (quantitative easing):

1. **2008-2014**: QE1, QE2, QE3 (post-crisis)
2. **2019-2020**: Balance sheet expansion resumed
3. **2020-2021**: Massive COVID stimulus (Fed + fiscal)
   - Fed Funds dropped to 0.06%
   - CAPE peaked at 38.3 in Dec 2021

### Current State (2024)
- **Tightening phase ended**: Fed hiked rates 2022-2023 (0% → 5%+)
- **Valuations remain elevated**: CAPE 30.8 vs. historical 16-17
- **But NOT at bubble extremes**: Still ~20% below 2021 peak

## Risk Assessment: What's Missing?

### ✅ What Aegis Currently Detects:
- Valuation extremes (CAPE, Buffett indicator)
- Credit stress (spreads widening)
- Dollar liquidity crises (funding shortages)
- Recession indicators (yield curve, unemployment velocity)
- Fed policy trajectory (rate changes)

### ❌ What Aegis Currently MISSES (Catalysts):

1. **Geopolitical Shocks**
   - Wars, trade conflicts, political crises
   - Currently: Manual overlay only (not systematic)
   - **Need**: News sentiment analysis, event detection

2. **Earnings Recessions**
   - Profit margin compression
   - Forward guidance deterioration
   - **Partially detected**: Signal #4 (earnings velocity)
   - **Need**: Earnings call sentiment, guidance tracking

3. **Credit Events**
   - Individual bank failures (SVB 2023)
   - Corporate defaults accelerating
   - **Partially detected**: Spread widening (lagging)
   - **Need**: Real-time credit default swap (CDS) monitoring

4. **Black Swan Events**
   - Pandemics, natural disasters
   - Technological disruptions
   - **Not detected**: Unpredictable by nature
   - **Need**: News monitoring for rapid response

5. **Liquidity Crises (Intra-Market)**
   - Flash crashes, margin calls
   - Dealer inventory stress
   - **Not detected**: Monthly data too coarse
   - **Need**: Daily/weekly market microstructure data

## Conclusion: Current Market (Dec 2024)

**The Good:**
- No systemic credit stress
- No dollar funding panic
- No recession imminent
- Fed tightening cycle appears complete

**The Bad:**
- Valuations 80% above historical average
- Extended bull market (2009-2024 with brief corrections)
- High sensitivity to negative catalysts

**The Verdict:**
Markets are in a **"fragile equilibrium"** state:
- Expensive valuations make markets vulnerable
- But no immediate crisis triggers visible
- A catalyst (geopolitical, earnings, credit) could spark a correction
- Without a catalyst, expensive markets can persist for years (see 1995-2000)

**Aegis Signal**: Stay invested but cautious. Build cash gradually if valuations spike further (CAPE >35). Monitor for catalyst emergence.
